The watchdog process costantly checks all the others processes (except the starter one), and it detects is the system is doing something or not.
It uses a timer which is resetted every time a process does something.
In order to check the other processes, the watchdog receives a signal every time some movement is done.
If all processes do nothing for at least 60 seconds, the watchdog sends a reset command to the motors.
