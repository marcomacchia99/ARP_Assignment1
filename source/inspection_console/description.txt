The inspection console is used by the user to reading the position of the joist and to sending the reset and emergency stop command.
It recieves the position from the two motors (with a small measurement error), and it displays to the user.
If the button R is pressed, the inspection console sends the reset command to the motors.
If the button S is pressed, the inspection console generates a signal handled by the two motors, which indicates they have to immediately stop.
